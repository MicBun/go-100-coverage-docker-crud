User Interface: The client-side interface where the users interact with the application.

REST API Server: A server that exposes a RESTful API for performing CRUD operations and authentication.

Login Endpoint: An endpoint within the REST API that handles user authentication.

Login Service: A service that verifies the user credentials and generates a JWT token.

CRUD Endpoint: An endpoint within the REST API that handles the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of resources.

Database Server: A database server that stores the data for the application.

Authorization Service: A service that enforces access control to the REST API endpoints based on the user's role and the
    requested resource.

In this diagram, the user interacts with the application through the User Interface, which sends requests to the REST
    API Server. The Login Endpoint communicates with the Login Service to verify the user credentials and generate a JWT
    token. The CRUD Endpoint communicates with the Database Server to perform the CRUD operations on the data. Before
    the CRUD endpoint can access the data, it communicates with the Authorization Service to ensure that the user has
    the proper authorization. If the user is an admin, they can access all CRUD endpoints. If the user is a regular
    user, they can only access their profile.
